## How to use:
### Controls:
- Open the interface by holding ZR + R and tapping L  
- Hide windows by pressing L-Stick  
- Mouse controls (RECOMMENDED)
  - Navigate interface with a mouse
  - Connect mouse to switch via USB
- Controller controls (NOT RECOMMENDED)
  - Activate or deactivate controller mode by holding ZR + R and tapping ZL
  - Navigate window with D-Pad
  - Interact with windows using A or B
  - Change windows by holding Y and using shoulder buttons

### Building:
- Requires running Linux (Ubuntu recommended)
  - If you're running Windows, try [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)!
- Install [devkitPro](https://devkitpro.org/wiki/Getting_Started) with the switch-dev platform
- Clone or fork this repository
  - If using WSL, make sure to clone the repo inside your WSL directories! Using a folder on your windows machine with WSL drastically slows compile times
- Open bash and run `make`
  - To send to your switch (requires editing FPT_IP in makefile), run make send
  - To increase core usage for compile, run make -j# (# for total cores to use)
